# Sample Machine Learning Implementation

This repository contains sample implementations of various machine learning models and techniques. Below is a brief description of each model:

1. **LightGBM**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based algorithms and follows leaf-wise approach.
2. **CatBoost**: CatBoost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees. It is designed to efficiently handle categorical features.
3. **Stacking Regressor**: An ensemble learning method to combine multiple regression models via a meta-regressor.
4. **MLP Regressor**: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implementation that optimizes the squared-loss using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent.
5. **XGBoost**: XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library. It is highly efficient, flexible and portable.
6. **AdaBoost**: AdaBoost, short for "Adaptive Boosting", is a boosting algorithm used as an ensemble method to improve the model.
7. **Gradient Boosting**: Gradient Boosting builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion. It allows for optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions.

It serves as a demonstration of code structuring, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and ensemble learning.

**Note**: The actual implementation and datasets used in a specific project cannot be shared due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This repository is purely for illustrative purposes.
